## How to use the SDK?
The complete source code is available in this repository folder. You can either directly use it in your project via source code or get [nmpjs distribution](https://www.npmjs.com/package/asposewordscloud) (recommended). For more details, please visit our [documentation website](https://docs.aspose.cloud/display/wordscloud/Available+SDKs).

### Prerequisites

To use Aspose Words for Cloud SDK you need to register an account with [Aspose Cloud](https://www.aspose.cloud/) and lookup/create App Key and SID at [Cloud Dashboard](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps). There is free quota available. For more details, see [Aspose Cloud Pricing](https://purchase.aspose.cloud/pricing).

Required version of Node.js is 4.8.7 or higher.

### Installation

#### Install Aspose.Words-Cloud via NPM

From the command line:

	npm install asposewordscloud --save


### Sample usage

The examples below show how your application have to initiate and convert "doc" file to "pdf" using asposewordscloud library:
``` js
const { WordsApi, PostDocumentSaveAsRequest, SaveOptionsData } = require("asposewordscloud");

wordsApi = new WordsApi(AppSid, AppKey);

var request = new PostDocumentSaveAsRequest({
    name: "fileStoredInCloud.doc",
    saveOptionsData: new SaveOptionsData(
        {
            saveFormat: "pdf",
            fileName: "destination.pdf"
        })
});

wordsApi.postDocumentSaveAs(request).then((result) => {    
    console.log(result.body.code);    
}).catch(function(err) {
    // Deal with an error
    console.log(err);
});

```

Every method returns a chainable promise.

[Tests](test) contain various examples of using the SDK. You have to create "testConfig.json" file in project root to run them.
"testConfig.json" has the following structure
``` json
{
    "AppSid": "Youre AppSid here",
    "AppKey": "Youre AppKey here",
    "BaseUrl": "http://api.aspose.cloud"
}
```

# Release notes
## 18.5
+ Added support of new "Classification" api
+ Added "documentFileName" parameter for PUT methods

## 18.3
+ Added support of differrent api version (v1 is used by default)
+ Swf format was removed
+ Some obsolete properties were removed from the PdfSaveOptionsData (see https://docs.aspose.cloud/display/wordscloud/Aspose.Words+for+Cloud+18.3+Release+Notes)

## 18.2
New SDK has the following advantages over the [previous version](https://github.com/aspose-words/Aspose.Words-for-Cloud):
+ SDK is fully in sync with the API, all missing methods are added
+ Classes, methods and properties have comments and are IDE-friendly
+ Better security
+ Usage of Request/Response classes to represent long lists of parameters. This allows for cleaner code and easier backwards-compatibility going forward
+ Chainable promise support

New SDK is not backwards compatible with previous generation because of the last item. It should be straightforward to convert your code to using Request/Response objects, if you need any help on migration please ask at [Free Support Forums](https://forum.aspose.cloud/c/words).
